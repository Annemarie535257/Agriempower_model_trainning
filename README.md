### ‚úÖ **Introduction**

AgriEmpower Rwanda aims to improve loan access for women-led agricultural cooperatives in rural Rwanda. These women are vital to the farming sector but are often excluded from formal credit due to lack of documentation and digital access. The project uses machine learning and alternative data‚Äîlike age or credit score to assess loan eligibility.

### ‚ùó **Problem Statement**

Rural women face systemic barriers to credit because traditional lending requires documents, collateral, and bank proximity. AgriEmpower offers a solution by using locally relevant data and an interpretable ML model to predict loan eligibility, promoting financial inclusion.

### üìä Dataset Used

This project uses a publicly available loan approval dataset sourced from Kaggle, titled loan_data.csv. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables relevant to loan eligibility, such as income, employment status, credit history, and loan amount.

After preprocessing, the data is cleaned, one-hot encoded for categorical features, and scaled to optimize training performance for both traditional machine learning models and neural networks.

Neural Network: The best-performing neural model was Model 3, which used:

Optimizer: RMSprop

Regularization: L2

Dropout Rate: 0.3

Architecture: [64, 32, 16] (7-layer network including dropout)

Performance:

Accuracy: 0.9931

F1 Score: 0.9789

Recall: 0.9847

Precision: 0.9732

This model provided the most balanced and accurate predictions, making it the most reliable option among all configurations tested.

üî¨ Discussion: ML Algorithm vs. Neural Network
While classical models like Logistic Regression provided strong baseline performance, Neural Networks clearly outperformed traditional algorithms on this dataset. The best-performing model was a CNN with L2 regularization and RMSprop optimizer, achieving the highest accuracy, F1 score, and recall. This highlights the capacity of neural networks to capture complex, nonlinear patterns when properly regularized and optimized.

Key Takeaways:
Neural Networks, especially when combined with L2 regularization and RMSprop, offered superior performance, demonstrating their ability to generalize well even on structured tabular data.

Logistic Regression remained competitive and was a strong baseline, especially in contexts requiring interpretability and low computational cost.

The use of regularization (L1/L2), dropout, and early stopping played a critical role in enhancing model stability and preventing overfitting.

Model performance varied significantly across different optimizers and regularizers, underscoring the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
